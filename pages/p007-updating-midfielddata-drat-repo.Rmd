## Introduction

We use the drat package to deploy the midfielddata package as a GitHub repository instead of deploying it to CRAN because the package exceeds the CRAN size limits. 

These guidelines are a quick overview of how to go about updating the midfielddata package when needed. You can read more about it at Dirk Eddelbuettel's [Drat basics for package authors](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/vignettes/dratforauthors/)

First time only, 

- Clone a local copy of the MIDFIELDR drat repo.
- Install the drat package. 



## Update the drat repo


- Once the work in the midfielddata package is complete, run R CMD build to produce the  `midfielddata_x.x.x.tar.gz` file, where `x.x.x` is the version number.
- Note the path to the local drat repo, e.g., `C:/path/to/local/drat`. 
- In R change your working directory to the file location of the `.tar.gz` file and run: 

```r
        drat::insertPackage("midfielddata_x.x.x.tar.gz", "C:/path/to/local/drat")
```

- Check by navigating to the local directory `drat\src\contrib`. You should see the latest `midfielddata_x.x.x.tar.gz` file there  
- Commit and push to the GitHub repo 
- Check by installing the new version of midfielddata locally by running 

 ```r
        install.packages("midfielddata", repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", type = "source")
```       

- Run `library("midfieldata")` and open the data files to confirm that your changes appear.

If you already have R and RStudio installed, please update to the most recent releases and update your R packages as well.


- Running old software can be considerably harder than running new software.
- R updates about twice a year.
- Get current at the start of a new project, but avoid updating if you are approaching a project deadline.
- Read more about it at [Maintaining R](https://whattheyforgot.org/maintaining-r.html){target="_blank"}, a chapter in (Bryan and Hester, [2019](#ref-Bryan+Hester:2019)).




## update R

On a Windows machine, we update R using the R GUI running as an administrator.

- Navigate to your most recent `Rgui.exe` file located in your Programs directory, e.g., `C:\Program Files\R\R-3.5.3\bin\x64\Rgui.exe`  
- Right-click on `Rgui.exe` and run as administrator

In the R GUI window that appears, run the commands
    
    if (!require("installr")) {install.packages("installr")}
    library("installr")
    updateR()

OK all defaults with one possible exception. 

- If you have designated a particular directory for your R libraries in a `.Renviron file`, for example, I use the `C:/R/library` directory, then answer "no" to the library questions in the R update.
- If not, you can answer "yes" to the update the library question. 




## update RStudio

Check for updates from the RStudio menu *Help \> Check for Updates*.

If *Check for Updates* does not appear in the menu,

  - Find the current version of RStudio from the menu *Help \> About
    RStudio*  
  - Navigate to the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop){target="_blank"}, find
    out what the current version is.

If you decide to update RStudio, close RStudio on your machine, download
the new version, and run the `RStudio-n.n.n.exe` as an administrator
(`n.n.n` is the current version number).

## update R packages

**From within RStudio**

  - From the RStudio pane, Select *Packages \> Update*
  - OR, from the menu, *Tools \> Check for Package updates …*

When updating packages, if a window pops up asking about compilation,

  - NO saves time
  - YES gets you the latest version but can be time-consuming. Don’t say
    yes if you are in a hurry to get some work done.

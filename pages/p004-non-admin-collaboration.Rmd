```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
opts_chunk$set(warning = TRUE, message = TRUE) 
knit_hooks$set(inline = function(x) {
	if (!is.numeric(x)) { 
		x 
		} else if (x >= 10000) { 
		prettyNum(round(x, 2), big.mark = ",")

	})
```

To proceed, the **author** has a project in a GitHub repo and wants to invite a **collaborator**. 

Both author and collaborator have completed the [Installing software](p001-install-software.md) instructions. 

In this approach, the collaborator is not an administrator so their work has to be reviewed by one of the administrators before being accepted. Student collaborators  might fall into this category. 

The repo author: 

- Make the repo public so the collaborator can fork it. 
- Give the repo URL to the collaborator

The collaborator: 

- Navigate to the repo
- Click the *Fork* button and select the destination (typically their GitHub account)

installing software
================

Before we can collaborate using GitHub, both you and your collaborator
have to install software and setup accounts as follows.

## install R and RStudio

Both you and your collaborator install R and RStudio on your local
machines. If you already have R and RStudio installed, please update to
the most recent releases and update your R packages as well.

Windows users may have to login as an Administrator before installing
the software.

    for your operating system  
-   <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop" target="_blank">Install RStudio</a>,
    a user interface for R

## install git

Both you and your collaborator install git on your local machines. Once
installed, we access its functionality via the RStudio interface.

Jenny Bryan provided these installation instructions for a workshop I
attended. I suggest you read all the instructions before starting.

-   [Git already
    installed?](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#git-already-installed)
-   [Windows](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows)
    install
-   [Mac OS](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#macos) install
-   [Linux](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#linux) install

Optional reading: Read sections 1 and 2 of [Excuse me, do you have a
moment to talk about version
control?](https://dx.doi.org/10.7287%2Fpeerj.preprints.3159v2) for a
good introduction to version control.

## setup GitHub

Both you and you collaborator need an account with GitHub.

GitHub is a hosting service that provides an online home for your
Git-based projects—critically important for sharing with collaborators.
Once you have a GitHub account, you will update your repositories using
the RStudio interface.

-   [Join GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/students) —
    it’s free.

Once you have a GitHub account, do the following steps. I suggest you
read the full instructions for a step before doing that step.

-   Some instructions ask you to type commands in the “shell”. To access
    the shell, open RStudio and use the pulldown menu *Tools &gt;
    Shell*.
-   [Introduce yourself to
    Git](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html#hello-git) using the
    name and email you used with your GitHub account
-   [Cache your username and
    password](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html#credential-caching)
    or so you don’t need to authenticate yourself to GitHub
    interactively ad nauseum. Alternatively, you can [set up SSH
    keys](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#ssh-keys).
-   [Prove RStudio can find local
    Git](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html#rstudio-git-github)
    and, therefore, can talk to GitHub

Cleanup

-   Close the Shell window
-   Delete the test project on your machine
-   Delete the test repo on GitHub, *Settings &gt; Danger Zone &gt;
    Delete this repository*

We start by assuming an **author** has created an RStudio "project" on their local machine and has linked it to a GitHub repository (a "repo"). The author is ready to share work with an **assistant**. Both author and assistant should have completed the [Installing software](p001-install-software.md) instructions.

In this approach, the assistant's work is submitted to the project as a pull request that requires review by the author (or other project administrator) before acceptance.

## author's initial tasks

- Make the GitHub repo public  
- Provide the repo URL to the assistant



## assistant's initial tasks

The assistant "forks" and "clones" the project as follows. 

- Navigate to the project repo using the URL provided by the project admin 
- Click the *Fork* button and select the destination (typically your GitHub account)  
- Navigate to your GitHub account and select the project repo (the fork) saved there 
- *Code* pulldown menu and copy the URL, for example: 

![](../resources/git-collab-001.png)

- Keep the URL in your clipboard or save it locally in a temporary text file 
- Launch RStudio
- *File > New Project* and select *Version Control* 

![](../resources/git-collab-002.png)

- Select *Git*

![](../resources/git-collab-003.png)

- In the dialog box, paste the *Repository URL* you saved earlier 
- The *Project directory name* is auto-filled 
- Use the *Browse* button to select the local directory for storing the project files 
- Click the *Create project* button

The assistant now has a local repo that matches the fork they created.

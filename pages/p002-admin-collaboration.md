collaboration among project administrators
================

To proceed, the **author** has a project in a GitHub repo and wants to
invite a **collaborator**.

Both author and collaborator have completed the [Installing
software](p001-install-software.md) instructions.

In this approach, the collaborator has authority to edit the project
material without pre-approval by other administrators.

The repo author:

-   Make the repo public or private
-   Obtain the collaborator’s GitHub name or email address associated
    with their GitHub account
-   Navigate to the project repo on GitHub
-   Click on the *Settings* icon
-   Click on the *Manage access* tab
-   Click on the *Invite teams or people* button
-   Type the collaborator’s GitHub name or email in the dialog box.

The collaborator:

-   Receives the invitation and accepts the invitation

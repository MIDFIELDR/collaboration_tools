If you already have R and RStudio installed, please update to the most recent releases and update your R packages as well.


- Running old software can be considerably harder than running new software.
- Get current at the start of a new project, but avoid updating if you are approaching a project deadline.
- Read more about it at [Maintaining R](https://whattheyforgot.org/maintaining-r.html){target="_blank"}, a chapter in (Bryan and Hester, [2019](#ref-Bryan+Hester:2019)).




## update R

To determine the most recent version of R, navigate to the R website [(link)](https://www.r-project.org). To see the version of R on your local machine, run the following line in the console, 

```r
R.version
```

You should see an output something like, 

```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
R.version
```


To update, install the installr package using the RStudio *Packages > Install*, and type `installr` in the dialog box or you can just type `install.packages("installr")` in the console. 

> Note. For some users the following guidelines work only by logging as an administrator. 

Next (on a Windows machine) we update R using the R GUI

- Close RStudio
- Navigate to your most recent `Rgui.exe` file located in your Programs directory, e.g., `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.5\bin\x64\Rgui.exe`  
- Run `Rgui.exe`

In the window that appears, run the commands

    library("installr")
    updateR()

OK all defaults with one possible exception. If you have designated a directory for R packages (for example, I store all my R packages in a `C:/R/library` directory) then answer "no" to the library questions in the R update.





## update RStudio

Check for updates from the RStudio menu *Help \> Check for Updates*.

If *Check for Updates* does not appear in the menu,

  - Find the current version of RStudio from the menu *Help \> About
    RStudio*  
  - Navigate to the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop){target="_blank"}, find
    out what the current version is.

If you decide to update RStudio, close RStudio on your machine, download
the new version, and run the `RStudio-n.n.n.exe` as an administrator
(`n.n.n` is the current version number).

## update R packages

**Update CRAN packages**

  - From the RStudio pane, Select *Packages \> Update*
  - OR, from the menu, *Tools \> Check for Package updates …*

When updating packages, if a window pops up asking about compilation,

<img src="../resources/cm904-01.png" width="40%" />

  - NO saves time
  - YES gets you the latest version but can be time-consuming. Don’t say
    yes if you are in a hurry to get some work done.

**Update without permission prompts**

Run

```r
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```


**Update and include packages in GitHub repositories**

Install the remotes package.  Then run, 

```r
remotes::update_packages()
```
